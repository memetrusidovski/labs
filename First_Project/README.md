# Welcome to The First Task!

Hi! This is the first project in a series for **Innovate Albania**. These modules and tutorials aim to teach the basics of computer programming starting with the most beginner friendly and popular language **Python**.  Python is used in areas like machine learning, web development, data science, simulations, building databases, and much more.



# Python Files

Python files are where your code is written. These Python files are run from the black box in the bottom right of your screen. This black box is known as **The Terminal**. You may have seen the terminal before and not known what it was for. The Terminal always you to type in commands that are executed by your computer. You can go ahead and test it out by typing in: 

```python Hello.py```

>Notice the H in hello is capitalized. The terminal will not run your python file if the characters do not perfectly match.
